Here’s a guide to help you create a complete requirements document for your real-time object detection program using YOLO with OpenCV. This will include a brief description of the project, the required packages, and how to set up the environment. You can use this as a README file for your GitHub repository.

Project Title: Real-Time Object Detection using YOLO
Description
This project implements real-time object detection using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm with OpenCV. It captures video from a webcam, detects objects in real-time, and displays bounding boxes with labels on the detected objects. Specifically, this implementation can detect mobile devices, printing "Mobile device detected" to the console when a device is identified.

Requirements
To run this project, ensure you have the following installed:

Python: Version 3.6 or higher.
OpenCV: For computer vision tasks.
NumPy: For numerical operations.
Installation
Follow these steps to set up the project environment:

Clone the Repository

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/real-time-object-detection.git
cd real-time-object-detection
Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install Required Packages Use the following command to install the required packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install opencv-python numpy
Download YOLO Weights and Configuration Files

Download the YOLOv4 weights and configuration files from the official YOLO website.
You will also need the coco.names file, which contains the class labels for the COCO dataset. You can download it from this link.
Place the downloaded files in the yolo_files directory specified in your code.
Run the Program After setting up the environment and downloading the required files, run the program:

bash
Copy code
python real_time_object_detection.py
Code Overview
The main function of this script is real_time_object_detection(), which performs the following steps:

Loads the YOLO model with the specified configuration and weights.
Captures video from the default webcam.
Processes each video frame to detect objects using YOLO.
Displays detected objects with bounding boxes and labels.
Prints "Mobile device detected" to the console when a mobile device is identified.
Usage
Press 'q' to quit the video stream at any time.
Ensure you have adequate lighting and a clear view of the objects for better detection accuracy.
